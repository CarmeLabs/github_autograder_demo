## Autograding Test

This is meant to do an autograding test via the GitHub Autograder.

In this sample, `lab.ipynb` represents the student submission.

The autograding directory will be downloaded via zip, but it is included here for demonstration purposes.

The autograder will kick off the `grade.sh` script.

It is currently unclear where the output of the autograder script will go, but multiple options are currently being explored.
